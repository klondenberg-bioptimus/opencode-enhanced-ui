# OpenCode Enhanced UI

**An enhanced VS Code extension that brings OpenCode sessions into your editor with powerful organization, visual customization, and workflow tools.**

> **Built for productive AI-assisted development:** browse sessions with a **workspace-aware sidebar**, customize your **panel themes**, track **subagents and todos**, organize with **tags and search**, and keep everything visible while you code—whether you work locally or over **Remote SSH**.

## Visual tour 👀

### Sessions sidebar with search and tags

The sidebar gives you a workspace-first view of your OpenCode sessions. Create, reopen, refresh, tag, filter, and search conversations without leaving VS Code.

Search sessions within one workspace at a time, or filter by tags to organize your active work.

### Panel theme system

Choose from three visual presets to match your workflow preference. All themes automatically adapt to VS Code's light or dark mode.

| Default Theme | Codex Theme | Claude Theme |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Default theme](docs/screenshots/theme-default.png) | ![Codex theme](docs/screenshots/theme-codex.png) | ![Claude theme](docs/screenshots/theme-claude.png) |
| Standard OpenCode styling | Tool-like preset with stronger framing | Softer preset with gentler surfaces |

### Dedicated conversation tabs

Each session opens in its own tab, making it easier to keep multiple threads organized while you continue editing code in the same window.

### Subagents companion view

Track subagent sessions spawned by the focused session in a dedicated sidebar panel. Monitor their status and navigate between parent and child sessions effortlessly.

### Enhanced todo and modified files views

Companion views help you triage focused-session tasks with grouped sections and filters, and inspect which files changed during the conversation.

### Compact skill invocations

Skill usage is rendered as clean, compact markers that don't clutter your transcript while still providing full visibility into what skills are being used.

## Remote SSH ready 🌐

OpenCode Enhanced UI runs on the correct extension host, so Remote SSH sessions stay aligned with the active workspace.

- Runs against the remote machine when you use Remote SSH
- Preserves workspace identity across local and remote folders
- Keeps file opening and panel restore behavior aligned with the active workspace
- All enhanced features work seamlessly over SSH

## Requirements

- **VS Code `1.94.0` or newer**
- **`opencode` installed on the active extension host and available on `PATH`**

If you use Remote SSH, **install `opencode` on the remote host** so the extension can launch `opencode serve` there.

## Quick start ⚡

1. Open a project folder in VS Code.
2. Confirm `opencode` is available in that environment.
3. Open the OpenCode view from the Activity Bar.
4. Run `OpenCode: Check Environment` if you want to verify setup first.
5. Create a new session or reopen one from the sidebar.
6. Right-click an editor selection or current file to open OpenCode with prefilled context.
7. Right-click selected files in the Explorer to seed a new session with multiple file refs.
8. Use the always-visible OpenCode status bar entry to reopen the active session or start a quick session from the current editor.
9. Customize your experience in settings: choose a panel theme, configure diff rendering, and adjust visibility options.
